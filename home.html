                <h3>About Us</h3>
               <p>When most people think of computer science, solving global challenges might not be the first thing that comes to mind. Unfortunately, this overlooks the fact that the problem-solving skills honed through computer science can be directly applied to real-world issues. At Hamilton Code for Change, we believe high school hackathons and competitions are a powerful platform for students to use their computer science skills in meaningful ways. These events allow participants to see firsthand how coding can lead to impactful solutions for complex, global problems. Through hands-on experience, hackathons offer a unique opportunity to not only refine your coding/math abilities but also witness the true potential of technology to drive positive change in the world. We would be thrilled if you could join us on our journey to change the world through the power of coding.</p>
