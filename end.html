				<h4> Our Mission </h4>
				<p>At Hamilton Code for Change, we believe that computer science and mathematics aren’t just technical skills, they’re powerful tools for solving real-world problems. We empower high school students to explore the social impact of code through innovative hackathons, competitions, and collaborative projects. </p>
				
				<h4> By The Numbers </h4>
				<p>- 60+ students engaged from Westmount Secondary School and across HWDSB </p>
				<p>- 2 major events hosted this academic year</p>
				<p>- 100% of participants worked on real-world challenges </p>
				<p>- Countless hours of creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking </p>
				
				<h4> 2025 Skills Contest – March 27, 2025 </h4>
				<p>- Our board-wide competition brought together students from across HWDSB to tackle an economics-based coding challenge. Participants </p>
				<p>- Modeled wealth inequality using Lorenz curves and Gini indexes </p>
				<p>- Applied math principles to real global economic data </p>
				<p>- Created algorithms to quantify and visualize inequality </p>
				<p>- Practiced data analysis, problem-solving, and coding under time constraints </p>
				
				<h4> Encrypt the Future Hackathon – May 22, 2025 </h4>
				<p>- This event invited students to take on one of the most pressing challenges of our time: cybersecurity. Participants:</p>
				<p>- Built tools to help protect small businesses from cyber threats</p>
				<p>- Created coding projects, business proposals, or hybrids of both </p>
				<p>- Learned about data security, cybercrime prevention, and the ethics of digital safety </p>
				<p>- Competed for prizes and recognition </p>
				
				<h4> Thank you </h4>
				<p>None of this would be possible without the incredible students, teachers, volunteers, and supporters who made this year a success. Your passion fuels our mission to make technology a tool for positive change.

Let’s keep coding. Let’s keep changing the world.
